# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** 🎉

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/kawamataryo/vue-word-highlighter).


## Pull Requests

- **Keep the same style** - eslint will automatically be ran before committing

- **Tip** to pass lint tests easier use the `yarn lint:fix` command

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure your commits message means something
